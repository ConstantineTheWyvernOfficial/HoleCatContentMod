			AUTOBIAGRAPHY : Volume I
			By Joan Curen
			'''
		Page2:
			'''
			My life began on a riverside farm on the mainland of Musevuria.
			I learned to read quite early on, but the skill was largely
			unacknowledged by my family. All they were concerned with 
			was my usefulness taking care of the livestock. As such,
			I did a lot of work on that farm. When there wasnt much to do
			on the farm, I would visit the neighbor, as the neighbor had
			many books to read. 
			'''
		Page3:
			'''
			When I became a young man, I left the farm to pursue more
			knowledge. That led me to a school in Ebüchmoon, a northern
			territory of Museveria. I had to work some odd jobs, do a
			few favors, and had to make a professor commit adultery by
			sleeping with me; it was a necessary evil. My efforts did
			pay off in the end, as I was allowed to study at that
			school and prepare for a career in scholarly exploration.
			'''
		Page4:
			'''
			To begin my career, I decided to leave the mainland and
			explore somewhere only travelling merchants spoke of. 
			An island thousands of helans away called "Terraria".
			I was not able to take very many books with me, as they
			would weigh on the boat too much. Out of those few books,
			I could only take so many written ones, as the purpose
			of the exploration was to fill books, not read them.

			LIVING SHADOWS: A MATERIAL ANALYSIS
			By: Joan Curen
			'''
		Page2:
			'''
			Living Shadows are a material found inside the bodies of
			the various creatures that come out of hiding in a solar eclipse.
			The dark mass that composes most of it is very cold and sticky,
			having a consistency similar to tree sap.
			While the orange outer energy is quite the oppsite, burning
			my hands and damaging equipment on several occasions.
			'''
		Page3:
			'''
			I did find though, that by stimulating these blobs with an
			electrical current within a certain range of voltage, the
			energy will separate from the dark congealment.
			By placing this circuit inside separated chambers, I was
			able to place living shadows inside one after another,
			completing the circuit and then breaking it as to charge
			batteries with the energy, and fill canisters with the
			congealment.
